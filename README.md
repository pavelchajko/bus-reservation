Spring Boot Reservation System

UPDATE: An example can be found here: https://telly-boot.herokuapp.com/

Telly is a reservation system built with Spring Boot using many features of the Spring Framework. The program allows for users to search for reservations, book reservations, create reservations, etc.

In the application.properties file located in the resources folder, you must enter your own database details (username, password, url, etc).

If you are not using a MySQL database, you must add the connecter jar for whatever database you are using.
